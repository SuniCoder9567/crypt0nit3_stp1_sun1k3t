# MATCHING WITH *
For this chal, we had to _cd_ using globbing. We have to use _*_ to change our directory to /challenge as it is restricted by the challenge to put in the whole path. We use _cd /ch*_ which tranfers us to _/challenge/ directory, we run our executable program usinf _/run_ and get our flag.
```
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /ch*
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge$ ./run
You ran me with the working directory of /challenge! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{kfvZ4qc0Vqvqgqvjba4uX1OIBH2.dFjM4QDL3AjN1czW}
```

> FLAG -> pwn.college{kfvZ4qc0Vqvqgqvjba4uX1OIBH2.dFjM4QDL3AjN1czW}
