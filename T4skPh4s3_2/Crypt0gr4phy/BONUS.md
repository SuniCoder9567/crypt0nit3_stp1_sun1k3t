# CRYPTOHACK : ECC

## POINT ADDITION
Just followed the algorithm given.  
Due to this being in a finite field, the calculations are done using modulo `p` where `p=9739`.  
Substituting the values of P,Q and R, we get the flag.

```
def modularinv(value, p):
    return pow(value, -1, p)

def p_add(P, Q, a, p):
    if P == "O":
        return Q
    if Q == "O":
        return P

    x1, y1 = P
    x2, y2 = Q

    if x1 == x2 and (y1 + y2) % p == 0:
        return "O"

    if P != Q:
        numerator = (y2 - y1) % p
        denominator = modularinv((x2 - x1) % p, p)
        lam = (numerator * denominator) % p
    else:
        numerator = (3 * x1**2 + a) % p
        denominator = modularinv((2 * y1) % p, p)
        lam = (numerator * denominator) % p

    x3 = (lam**2 - x1 - x2) % p
    y3 = (lam * (x1 - x3) - y1) % p

    return (x3, y3)

a = 497
p = 9739
P = (493, 5564)
Q = (1539, 4742)
R = (4403, 5202)
res = p_add(P, P, a, p)
res = p_add(res, Q, a, p)
res = p_add(res, R, a, p)
    
print(res)

## EFFICIENT EXCHANGE

So we gotta calculate the shared secret but only the x coordinate from Alice is given `(815,3190)`.  
We are not given the y coordinate but we are given a set of hints from which we can derive the y coordinate.  
THe first thought that struck my mind was obviously to pu the value of x in the `Weierstrass equation` to get `y^2` out of it.  
Now to derive why from it, we are give the hint that the relation `pâ‰¡3mod4` is gonna help us calculate y from y^2.  
So, first let us calculate the two possible value of y.  
I wrote the block for that.
```
def sqrt(ysq, p):
    for i in range(1, p):
        if pow(i, 2) % p == ysq: #we need to consider with regard of %p as we are working with a finite field
            return (i, p - i)
```
So implementing this I found the two possible values of y to be `3452 & 6287`.  
Now to decide which is the correct one, we will use the hint they gave us (listed above).  
We need to check if `y % 4 == 3` in each case. The value of `y` which satisfies the case will be treated as the y component of Alice's public key.  
We find out that y2 aka `p-i` satisfies the relation, therefore satisfies the y component.  
We calculate the shared secret and give the x component to `decrypt.py` along with iv and ctext and just like that, we get aour flag.

# FLIPPY - MetaCTF
Took me some time to do it but I finally did so,  
The challenge provides a service that encrypts messages using CBC mode encryption. Our goal is to manipulate the encrypted message to execute code that prints the flag instead of our original input.
The service appears to have two main functions:

Encrypt a message  

Decrypt and process a message  


When we send a message for encryption, it returns the IV and ciphertext in hex format. The interesting part is that the service likely evaluates the decrypted message as Ruby code (indicated by the puts command format)  
Doing sm research, it turns out that CBC mode encryption is malleable i.e. we can modify the IV to cause predictable changes in the decrypted plaintext  
First we initialise, `now` and `send`, `now` is the message we are sending and send is the message we want to forge `now` into.
```
send = "puts       FLAG"
now = f"puts 'abcdefgh'"
assert len(target) == len(current)
```
The only possible solution is bit flipping using XOR.
```
xor = [ord(i) ^ ord(j) for i, j in zip(send, now)]
xor = itertools.chain(xor, itertools.cycle([0]))
newiv = bytes([i ^ j for i, j in zip(iv, xor)]).hex()
```
In CBC mode: plaintext = decrypt(ct) xor'd IV  

If we want to change the plaintext from A to B:  

We need: decrypt(ct) xor'd new_IV = B  

This means: newiv = ogiv xor'd (A xor'd B)

We combine this with the ciphertext (other 32 hex chars) and send it for decryption and voila we get the flag.  

_Note: The server connection was not provided so I made my own flag and retrieved it_
