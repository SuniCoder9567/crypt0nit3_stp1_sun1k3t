For this chal, I first run the chal and type in gibberish to see what the program does. Surprisingly, broskies gave us the expected ouput right there in the errogenous output.  

I converted the given code ` 61 6a 7a 6e 68` into ASCII which turned out to be `ajznh`.  
Running it gave me the flag.  
```
ajznh
Initial input:

        61 6a 7a 6e 68

The mangling is done! The resulting bytes will be used for the final comparison.

Final result of mangling input:

        61 6a 7a 6e 68

Expected result:

        61 6a 7a 6e 68
